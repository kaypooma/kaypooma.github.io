        <h1>notitg</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>i found out about stepmania in 2011 from a youtube video and decided to try it (yes i liked it)</p>
        <p>around 2013 i discovered modded files through the windeu tournaments</p>
        <p>modfiles kind of rekindled my interest in playing stepmania after i started getting a little bored of regular charts</p>
        <p>around this time i tried to figure out how to make my own modfiles, but my progress halted due to lack of resources / me not being smart</p>
        <p>during 2015-2017 i started playing other rhythm games more regularly and kind of forgot about stepmania, but around late 2017 i found out about uksrt8 through YouTube Recommendations and decided to try it</p>
        <p>after playing through uksrt8 and joining the uksrt server, i started relearning how to make modfiles and actually made some progress this time around</p>
        <p>in may 2018 i released my first finished modfile, some things happened in between, and now i have like 29 finished and released modfiles somehow</p>

        <h1>music</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>i started making music as a hobby around 2014</p>
        <p>i made a couple of not very good songs (that are still publicly uploaded on youtube) and after that i didn't really make anything for like 2 years</p>
        <p>in 2016 i started making ztochei where i was supposed to make one song per day (one for each letter in the greek alphabet), but that didn't work out and i stopped making them daily after the 6th song</p>
        <p>disregarding that i have been doing ztochei for around 4 years and i think that it has helped me improve a decent amount in my music making endeavors, and i think ztochei also serves as a kind of progress indicator for me so i can see how much i have improved overtime</p>

        <hr>

        <h1>art</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>for art i was drawing on and off from 2013 (i would like to forget about this era) to 2019, but i started drawing more frequently around december 2019</p>
        <p>as of september 2020 i have been drawing for around 10 months, and i think i have gotten better</p>
        <p>i still have a lot of things to work on and improve though so maybe i will learn even more over the next 2 years or something</p>

        <hr>
